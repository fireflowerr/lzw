The test runner is implemented by creating md5 checksum for each original file,
and each file that has been encoded and decoded. If the md5 checksum matches
the original, success is emitted along with statistics, else emits failure. To
successfully execute the test runner both lzw.jar and 7z.exe must be on system
path (you can put in current directory or add to system path variable).

Usage: java -jar lzw-test.jar *test directory* [optional --logging]
Example: java -jar lzw-test.jar ../test (if cd is target)
